# Gesture Recognition System 👋🖱️

An AI-powered virtual mouse system enabling hands-free computer control through intuitive hand gestures.

## ✨ Features

- *🖐️ Gesture-Based Control*: Control cursor movements and execute clicks using hand gestures
- *♿ Accessibility-Focused*: Designed to enhance computer accessibility for specially-abled individuals
- *⚡ Real-Time Processing*: Utilizes MediaPipe for efficient hand tracking and OpenCV for gesture recognition
- *🎯 High Accuracy*: Achieves 92-97% gesture recognition accuracy in controlled environments

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.8.5
- MediaPipe (Hand tracking)
- OpenCV (Computer vision)
- PyAutoGUI (Mouse control automation)

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Create a virtual environment
bash
conda create --name gest python=3.8.5
conda activate gest


### Step 2: Install dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 3: Run the application
bash
python Gesture_Controller.py


## 🤲 Gesture Controls

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Move hand | Move cursor across the screen |
| Index finger extended | Left click |
| Middle finger extended | Right click |
| Quick double index motion | Double click |
| Closed fist | Drag and drop / Scroll |
| Open palm (5 fingers) | Cancel or reset current action |
| Pinch (Thumb + Index Up/Down) | Increase or decrease system volume |
| Pinch (Thumb + Index Right) | Increase or decrease screen brightness |
| Left index + thumb pinch | Zoom in or zoom out (adjust page size) |

## 🔄 How It Works

The system captures video input from your webcam and processes it through a computer vision pipeline:

1. *Video Capture*: Acquires real-time video stream from webcam
2. *Hand Detection*: MediaPipe tracks 21 hand landmarks with sub-pixel accuracy
3. *Gesture Recognition*: Analyzes hand configurations to identify specific gestures
4. *Action Execution*: Translates recognized gestures into corresponding mouse actions

## 👥 Use Cases

- Accessibility assistance for individuals with limited mobility
- Hands-free computing in sterile environments (medical/lab settings)
- Convenient multitasking during presentations or cooking
- Touchless public kiosk interfaces

## 📋 Requirements

*Hardware:*
- Webcam (720p, 30 FPS minimum)
- Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or equivalent
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)

*Software:*
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- numpy
- pyautogui

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- *Poor detection*: Ensure proper lighting and clear hand visibility
- *Cursor jitter*: Increase smoothing factor in configuration
- *Performance lag*: Close resource-intensive applications or reduce frame rate

*Built for accessible, intuitive human-computer interaction* ❤️
